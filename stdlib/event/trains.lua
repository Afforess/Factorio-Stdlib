--- Tools for working with trains.
-- When this module is loaded into a mod, it automatically registers a number of new events in order to keep track of the trains as their locomotives and wagons are moved around.
-- <p>To handle the events, you should use the @{Event} module.
-- @module Trains

-- Event registration is performed at the bottom of this file,
-- once all other functions have been defined

require 'stdlib/event/event'
local Surface = require 'stdlib/area/surface'
local Entity = require 'stdlib/entity/entity'

Trains = {} --luacheck: allow defined top

--- This event fires when a train's ID changes.
-- <p>The train ID is a property of the main locomotive,
-- which means that when locomotives are attached or detached from their wagons or from other locomotives, the ID of the train changes.
-- <p>For example: A train with a front and rear locomotives will get its ID
-- from the front locomotive. If the front locomotive gets disconnected, the rear locomotive becomes the main one and the train's ID changes.
-- @event on_train_id_changed
-- @tparam uint old_id the ID of the train before the change
-- @tparam uint new_id the ID of the train after the change
-- @usage
